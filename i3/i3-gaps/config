# You can also use any non-zero value if you'd like to have a border
for_window [class=".*"] border pixel 0

# Gaps are defined using the following syntax:
gaps [inner|outer|horizontal|vertical|top|left|bottom|right] <px>
workspace <ws> gaps [inner|outer|horizontal|vertical|top|left|bottom|right] <px>

# "Smart gaps:"
# Only enable gaps on a workspace when there is at least one container
smart_gaps on

# Only enable outer gaps when there is exactly one container
smart_gaps inverse_outer

# "Smart borders:"
# Can only be enabled if gap between window and screen edge == 0
# Activate smart borders (always)
smart_borders on

# Activate smart borders (only when there are effectively no gaps)
smart_borders no_gaps

# Hide edge borders only if there is one window with no gaps
hide_edge_borders smart_no_gaps

# i3bar:
# If not set explicitly, the height will be determined based on font size
bar {
    # Height in pixels
    height 25
}

# Gaps can be modified at runtime like so:
gaps inner|outer|horizontal|vertical|top|right|bottom|left current|all set|plus|minus|toggle <px>

# Examples:
gaps inner all set 20
gaps outer current plus 5
gaps horizontal current plus 40
gaps outer current toggle 60
